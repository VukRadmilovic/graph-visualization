For the source data parsing plugins we chose:
1. XML data source
2. Wikipedia pages source (using scrapy library for parsing Wikipedia pages)

For the visualization plugins we chose:
1. Simple visualization - show nodes as circles with corresponding labels, linked with other nodes with simple lines
2. Complex visualization - show nodes as rectangles, inside of which are listed all attributes with their values, similar to UML class diagrams

Visualization will be implemented using D3.js library.
